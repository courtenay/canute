Canute (Cnut the Great) was a viking ruler who conquered England around 1015AD.  He was famous, in part,
for trying to rule even the waves of the sea.

This app has very little to do with the sea, or history for that matter, but it *is* all about rules.

It will take a series of user-defined rules and generate a SQL string to search your database.

TODO:

- Use Sphinx or another search engine. This will speed up LIKE queries, and we can generate the appropriate conditions just like we do with sql.
- More descriptive information about how to integrate with your app
- Pluginize
- Nicer layout
